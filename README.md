#TODO app - a single-page application to manage todos.
A user can enter & save todos via input form, mark them as completed and delete. 
Three tabs show All, Active and Completed todos. The latter tab provides a 'delete all' button, which removes all todos.
All submitted todos are being saved in Localstorage and are accessible after page reload or browser restart.
